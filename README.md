Project Info

Flight Suggestion System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel. The project is aimed at exposing the relevance and importance of Airline Reservation Systems. It is projected towards enhancing the relationship between customers and airline agencies through the use of ARSs, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software to make reservations. 

The main purpose of this project is to give the most affordable or the shortest distance flight ticket to the passenger for the destination by using a concept called Minimum Spanning Tree. This help passenger to  find the best route to a particular destination. It also help passenger to decide which layover to take or which route to take. 

The system allows the airline passenger to search for flights that are available between the two travel cities, namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price and duration of journey etc. 
When passenger tries to buy a ticket for a particular flight, the system will show the shortest available flight and the most affordable flight ticket available. So that the passenger can choose as per their requirement. 
So the system will show passenger the most affordable or the shortest flight ticket between two destination.
